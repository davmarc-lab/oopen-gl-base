# TODO

List of things to do in the opengl-three-dimension base:

- [x] Quaternions (to implement quaternion operation)
- [x] Camera (working camera system, could be improved choosing if the camera is controlled by user or attached to a mesh)
- [x] Textures (basic texture works, could change multi texture usage; you should rewrite this class...)
- [x] Lights (implemented basic class of lights)
- [x] Materials
- [ ] Physics ?
- [ ] Improve Mesh class (some patterns?) ?
- [ ] Basic Mesh (just make a single class for all meshes and build each one using an helper class):
    - [x] Cube
    - [ ] Sphere
    - [ ] Cone
    - [ ] Pyramid
    - [ ] Thorus
